        <p>Frameworks can be used to simplify the UX design and responsiveness on the front end of your project, or as a building block to begin expanding into the backend world of databases and templating.</p>
        <p>Like with any form of tool/software used in development, there are numerous types of frameworks, each with their own benefits and disappointments.</p>
        <p>Below is a list of a few frameworks (both front end and backend) to help you get started on your development journey</p>
