        <h4>Frameworks</h4>
        <p>"There is no need to reinvent the wheel". This is the perfect reason for using a framework when developing.</p>
        <p>Frameworks can be used to simplify the UX design and responsiveness on the front end of your project, or as a building block to begin expanding into the backend world of databases and templating.</p>
        <p>Like with any form of tool/software used in development, there are numerous types of frameworks, each with their own benefits and disappointments.</p>
        <p>Below is a list of a few frameworks (both front end and backend) to help you get started on your development journey</p>

                <p>Angular is a Type-Script-based web application framework that is free and open-source.</p>
                <p>Angular is used as the frontend of a MEAN stack, consisting of MongoDB database, Express.js web application server framework, Angular itself and Node.js server runtime environment.</p>
                <p>It uses hierarchy of components as its primary architectural characteristic and much of its core functionality is modular.</p>

                <h5 class="mt-0">React</h5>
                <p>React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library. It is primarily used for building user interfaces (UI) or components. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.</p>
                <p>React is only concerned with stat management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React Applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.</p>

                <p>Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.</p>
                <p>Vue.js allows for extending HTML with HTML attributes called directives. The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives.</p>

Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.</p>
