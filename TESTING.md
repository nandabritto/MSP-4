# Testing 

The following sections are the results of the testing throughout the software development lifecycle for MSP-4. This information has been included in a separate document in order to keep the README document uncluttered.


## Testing Plan

Testing will be conducted regularly alongside development of this project. Each User Story will include Unit testing of the code being developed and a manual exploratory test session.

During the manual exploratory test sessions:
- test cases will be identified for test automation
- site functionality will be verified
- cross browser/device compatibiliy will be confirmed
- general usibility will be assessed

Test automation will be conducted at regular intervals and with the implementation of major functionality.

Upon initial deployment the following testing will be conducted: 
- All unit tests
- The automation suite
- Manual shakedown of all functionality
- Performance testing of site loading
- Device and cross browser compatibility
- WAVE web accessibility tests
- WAI color contrast assessments (of the final colours and patterns)

## Testing Plan

The following list of tools have been utilised during the testing of this project:

## User Acceptance Testing:

Due to the size and timelines of this project, there will not be a structured Alpha/Beta stage of UAT. Instead, a selection of volunteers will conduct a time boxed exploratory session. After which feedback will be collated and transformed into bugs, improvements or new features.

The following is the feedback provided from the end users from their exploratory test session:


## Performance Testing:
The following evidence are the results from the performance speed test conducted on the deployed site:

## WAI Luminosity Colour Contrast Ratio Assessment

The following are the results of the Luminosity Colour Contract Ratio Analysis. This analysis determines the readability of the site based of background to foreground ratios as specified by the WAI. (https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/designing/)

## Production Shakedown Pre Submission

Note to Assessor: Due to GitPods behaviour surrounding links, (and unexpected CORBS errors) there are numerous commit messages directly after the deployment that are very similar. This is due to the need to push all changes to production to verify if the implemented fixes were successful.

Once the web application had been deployed the HTML code was passed through an  for the HTML portions:

![w3cvalidator]()

Once the web application had been deployed the CSS code was passed through the official Jigsaw validator for the CSS portions:

![jigsawvalidator]()

Once the web application had been deployed the JavaScript code was passed through the official Jshint validator for the JavaScript portions:

![jshintvalidator]()

All elements have been visually inspected to ensure all information has been correctly populated and loaded.

All visual elements have been validated by the WAI approved Luminosity Colour Contrast Ratio Analysis checker. These results are located within the testing document.

Once the web application has been deployed the site loading/performance will be tested to ensure there are no undue delays for the User
