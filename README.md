# Project Purpose

The purpose of Milestone Project 4 is to create a Full-Stack web application based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset as described in the assessment criteria.

# Project Summary

The goal of this web application is to develop an centralised reserviour of information for new (and not so new) software developers. A "one stop shop" for the basics on tools, languages, certifications etc. 


# Benefits and Rational

At a High level this site will provide:
- Information on industry standard certification providers (and links to official sites)
- Information on free and low cost "Badge" courses (and links to official sites)
- Lists of media providers that can be used in development of (non commercial) projects
- Details of available IDEs (and links to official sites)
- Details of available Frameworks to simplify development (and links to official sites)
- Details of handy tools (and links to official sites)
  - Agile Management tools
  - Code validators and beautifiers
  - Testing tools
- Practise Exams based on Industry standard certificates


## User Stories and Functional Requirements

The planning and maintenance of all significant functionality will be managed within the following JIRA.
	https://sphere42.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MSP04/boards
	*Credentials to this management tool will be provided to Code Institute during submission

A copy of the Agile project structure (Epics, User Stories(with points), and tasks) can be found within the agile.md document.

All project wireframes and UX design details are included within the applicable EPIC/ User story ticket.
There is the potential for variance between the initial UX design and the final product as the design will be adjusted based on feedback from User Acceptance Testing (both alpha and beta cycles).

Notes:
This project will progress utilising the Agile methodolgy. 
Development cycles (sprints) will be 7 days in length.
Initial Epics to be created for the project will be:
- Project Initial Setup
- Practise exams
- Resources
- User Registration/Login/Logout
- Certification Providers


At the begining of each sprint, there will be a planning session to determine the sprint goal, and the planned tickets to be included in the sprint.

Twice a sprint there will be a short refinement session to which current tickets are refined and additional Epics/User stories are added/refined to the backlog.

At the end of each sprint there will be a review session to demo what has been developed during the sprint.

Development progress is visible in the JIRA board and history of the tickets.

All defects will also be maintained within JIRA. Highlevel details will be contained within the Testing.md file.

Development of the MVP (Resources HTML and Practise Exams sections) will be conducted on the local dev environment. Once a stable MVP is available, initial deployment to heroku will occur. From there development will continue alongside User Testing.
