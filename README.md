# Project Purpose

The purpose of Milestone Project 4 is to create a Full-Stack web application based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset as described in the assessment criteria.

# Project Summary

The goal of this web application is to develop an centralised reserviour of information for new software developers. A "one stop shop" for the basics on tools, languages, certifications etc. 


## Benefits and Rational

At a High level this site will provide:
- Information on industry standard certification providers (and links to official sites)
- Information on free and low cost "Badge" courses (and links to official sites)
- Lists of media providers that can be used in development of (non commercial) projects
- Details of available IDEs (and links to official sites)
- Details of available Frameworks to simplify development (and links to official sites)
- Details of handy tools (and links to official sites)
  - Agile Management tools
  - Code validators and beautifiers
- Practise Exams based on Industry standard certificates
- (potentially) Random Project idea generator
- (potentially) User viewing previous results
- (potentially) discussion boards for newbies

## User Stories and Functional Requirements

The planning and maintenance of all significant functionality will be managed within the JIRA.
	https://sphere42.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MSP04/boards
	*Credentials to this management tool will be provided to Code Institute during submission

A breakdown of the Agile project structure (Epics, User Stories(with points), and tasks) can be found within the agile.md document.

All project wireframes and UX design details are included within the applicable EPIC/ User story ticket.
There is the potential for variance between the initial UX design and the final product as the design will be adjusted based on feedback from User Acceptance Testing (both alpha and beta cycles).

Notes:
This project will progress utilising the Agile Scrum methodolgy. 
Development cycles (sprints) will be 7 days in length.
Initial Epics to be created for the project will be:
- Project Initial Setup
- Practise exams
- Resources
- User Registration/Login/Logout
- Certification Providers
- Message Board

At the begining of each sprint, there will be a planning session to determine the sprint goal, and the planned tickets to be included in the sprint.

Twice a sprint there will be a short refinement session to which current tickets are refined and additional Epics/User stories are added/refined to the backlog.

At the end of each sprint there will be a review session to show what has been developed during the sprint.

Development progress is visible in the JIRA board and history of the tickets.

All defects will also be maintained within JIRA. Highlevel details will be contained within the Testing.md file.

Development of the MVP (Resources HTML and Practise Exams sections) will be conducted on the Master branch. Once the MVP is viable all further development will be conducted on separate branches before being merged to the Master.

# Future Features to be Implemented

- Creation of a User profile section
	- Ability to review previous practise exam results
	- Ability to analyse practise exam results (progress graph)


# Testing 

Full details and evidence of testing conducted throughout the software development life cycle of this project will be maintained in a seperate document called testing.md

At a high level testing will include:
- Automated JavaScript Unit Tests
- Automated Python Unit tests (within Django)
- Automated functional tests using Cypress
- Manual exploratory test sessions 
- User Acceptance testing (both Alpha and Beta test cycles)
- Performance Testing
- Security Review
